// Note: each line corresponds to one block of help messages.
// Syntax: minx:maxx:autotime:text1|text2|... 
// 
// The help message block becomes active when the maximal x coordinate of any player is in [minx,maxx]
// The next active message blocks are played when 
//   a) the help button is pressed 
//   b) the specified time in the column 3 ("autotime") has passed (in seconds). A negative value disables autoplay.

0:10:0:Looks like three robots united. Now they can help each other to succeed.
19:20:0:Since they are quite strong, they can carry each other. Try it out!
19:20:-1:Bruce is a good Jumper. Make him carry the other two.
19:20:-1:Go with one robot to Bruce and say jump. While being carried from Bruce both can jump up there.
30:35:0:Perfect. Look into their brains and you can see that they learned carry and mount. From now on you can use these commands.

//181:191:0:Uh-oh, looks like the human body wants to defend itself. Be careful!
198:205:0:These guys are not on an exploration trip, are they? | Curiosity reached a new level. Instead of just walking around, they want to get into the control center. | It seems like they want to figure out, if humans can be controlled and shut down - just like they do it with robots.

# BrainControl

A cognitive control architecture and also a platform video game developed at the chair of Cognitive Modelling at the University of Tuebingen.

> **Note** This is all work in progress and some things might be outdated. If something is unclear, please contact us - through opening an issue, preferably.

## Getting Started

1. Install espeak and java if necessary  
2. Clone the repository, build, then run "PlayRelease.java"  
3. This should start the game - further information will be made available shortly  
4. If you encounter a bug, consider creating an issue. Keep in mind that the cognitive architecture is very complex and might sometimes not behave as expected. Thus the more specific the bug-report is, the better.

### Dependencies

* CMUSphinx (included, cmusphinx.github.io)  
* java (>= 1.7)  
* espeak (espeak.sourceforge.net/)
